This unit is about the generics of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). It can be summarized as a concept promoting the use of standardized practices for organizing and sharing data and resources, and focuses on making data (F)indable by assigning persistent identifiers and using rich, informative metadata to describe its content. By emphasing (A)ccessibility it ensures that data can be accessed by both humans and machines, using open formats and providing clear access protocols. (I)nteroperability is achieved by adopting common data standards and formats, enabling data integration and exchange across different systems and platforms. Lastly, (R)eusability is emphasized by providing clear usage rights, as well as licensing and enabling data to be combined with other datasets. The generics of FAIR aim to maximize the potential impact of data and resources by making them more discoverable, accessible, and usable for both researchers and wider communities.

The contents are vital in building an understanding and overview of fundamental concepts required to put the FAIR principles into practice, and place them into a wider context. The FAIR generics lesson plan is divided into several topics organised in a progressive path where each topic can be viewed as a full or partial requirement for the next topic:

- 1.1 Why FAIR?
Introduces the general concept of FAIR, describing why potential and real stakeholders as well as other roles benefit from implementation of the FAIR principles, as well as the increasing incentives from journals, funding bodies and institutions for emphasising FAIR as a factor for scientific impact. A fundamental undestanding of FAIR and its role at all stages of research is vital for understanding the FAIR implementation process.

- 1.2 FAIR vs. Open data (science)
This topic contrasts the definitions of the FAIR principles with those of open science, how data benefits from openess and when data per definition cannot be open, and how open data relates to being made publicly available in certified and trusted respositories, supported by local as well as national data policies.

- 1.3 Data Life Cycle approach to FAIR/FAIR right from the start
The topic aims at increasing the undestanding of how the different stages of the data lifecycle relates to the FAIR principles, with the ultimate goal of making data FAIR by design. 

- 1.4 FAIR and/in institutional data policies
The topic addresses the importance of a standadised local institutional policies, and describes the overall benefits of FAIR data management and adpoting the FAIR principles at institutional level. 

- 1.5 Defining FAIR Objectives for a research / scientific project
A predefined plan for hanlding all parts of the data life cyle, from receiving to publishing research data, is vital to any research project, and the road to FAIRification of data requires the various stages of the data life cycle to be explicitly described in a data management plan. 

- 1.6 Defining FAIR Objectives for Organisations
Defining FAIR Objectives for Organisations (expand)

- 1.7 Policies and consent
The topic covers the importance of data access policies and describing how individual researchers can mediate the access to e.g. sensitive research data through a clear application and evaluation path independent of the individual researcher. It also emphasizes the importance of informed consent forms as a crucial step in the FAIRification of research data.
