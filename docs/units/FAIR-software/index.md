      link: 'topics/1-Defining-research-software'
      description: >
        This topic introduces the topic of research software. We provide a definition of research software and in doing so make a clear distinction between 'research software' and 'software in research'. We outline why the development and manangement of research software is important and clarify its placement within the research cycle. We also cover some of the challenges facing (the development of) research software in the current academic landscape.

      description: >
        This topic maps the FAIR framework onto research software. We assume that participants have basic knowledge of the generics of FAIR (data) from previous modules and instead focus on explaining how the FAIR framework for research software can facilitate code re-use, ensure reproducibility of computational workflows, make replication studies easier, save research time, and speed-up scientific progress.

      description: >
        This topic details how to ensure research software is findable by covering the fundamentals of software directories, personal identifiers, software metadata and clear descriptive information (e.g., README).

This unit is about FAIR research software. We define research software as code that has been created during the research process, such as analysis scripts or reusable tools. The unit maps the generics of the FAIR framework to research software and outlines how such an approach can add value to science by ensuring computational reproducibility, speeding-up scientific progress, facilitating replication studies and saving research time. (F)indable research software is archived within a software directory, has a clear description, personal identifier(s) and appropriate metadata. A(accesible) research software is hosted on a public software repository (e.g., GitHub) using an appropriate (open) licence. (I)interoperable research software uses common, open-source programming languages and uses open formats for input and output data. R(usable) research software, in addition to having an appropriate licence, and a public repository, is clearly documented, uses modular coding practices, version control and sufficient tests and environment snapshots to ensure reproducibility.
