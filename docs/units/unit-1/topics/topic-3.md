---

## FAIR element(s)

All FAIR elements

---

## Primary audience(s)

* Data stewards
* Researchers
* Data producing/analysis staff-scientists at a Research Infrastructure
* Anyone working with research data

---

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding about Research Data Management.

---

## Learning outcomes (Bloomâ€™s taxonomy)

* At the end of this lesson you will be able to define the FAIR principles (Understand/Remember)
* At the end of this lesson you will be able to define the different phases of the data life cycle (Understand/Remember)
* You will be able to list the reasons why you should start implementing FAIR at the start of the research life cycle/your project
* You will be able to recognize several versions/models of research data life cycle
* At the end of this lesson you will be able to describe ways of making your data FAIR at every phase of the research data life cycle 
* At the end of this lesson you are aware of the different tools, technologies and methods that are available to help with FAIR data at different phases of the research data life cycle (Understand/Remember)
* You will be able to apply tools that are available to assess the FAIRness of your data (Apply)
* You are able to describe the RDM policies at your institute _(discussion point - applicable to this lessonplan or another unit?)_
* At the end of this lesson you will be able to list the RDM and FAIR requirements from different funders (European and national) _(discussion point - applicable to this lessonplan or another unit?)_
* At the end of the lesson you will be able to make sure your data is following above mentioned requirements (Apply)
* You will be able to describe the relationship between open data with the different phases of the research data life cycle (_also see lesson plan on Open data vs FAIR - discussion point_)

## Delivery format

* In-person training
* Online training
    * Interactive training
    * Tutorial
    * Webinar

## Format of content

* Powerpoint
* PDF
* Games
* Excel/csv (for dataset for exercise)
* Videos

---

## Duration

Duration will be adjusted based on the overall scheme of the course, the audience and the delivery format.

* For webinar or tutorial, one hour is foreseen.
* For more interactive trainings it can be a morning/afternoon session

---

## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Exercise for audience: List the research life cycle phases and the applicable FAIR elements with explanations
* Prepare an exercise for the audience: using a particular tool to assess FAIRness in your research data/research data of researchers that you are supporting _(maybe this exercise is more suitable in other units? Instructors can also provide datasets)_
* Exercise for audience: Try to find datasets (through a repository) that are FAIR
* Exercise: play games (see references)

---

## Materials / Equipment

* Overview of different research data life cycle models
* Computer / laptop
* Internet / browser
* Whiteboard + markers
* Post-its
* Pre-reading material?
* Examples (good and not as good)?

## Preparation/getting to know the audience

* Motivation to follow the training
* Experience with FAIR research data

## Take home message

* You can relate different elements in DMP or in a research project in general to different phases of the data life cycle.
* When looking at the different phases of your own research project, you know which methods / tools can you apply to make your research FAIR
