## Topic, definition and scope

* Defining FAIR Objectives for a **research / scientific project as a part of data management plan creation.**

---

## FAIR element(s) (F, A, I and/or R)

* Pre-FAIRification
* All aspects of FAIR - because this topic is about a project defining the ways in which they are FAIR?
* …

---

## Primary audience(s)

* Project Manager / PI / Researcher
* Data Stewards
* Data Manager/Data Champion
* …
* …

---

## Learning outcomes

* Maturity Model (FAIR Evaluator and its metrics (see https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/assessing-fairness/fair-assessment-fairevaluator.html), FIP, FAIRplus Dataset Maturity Indicators (https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/))…
* E.g. Evaluate your existing dataset maturity by assigning a DSM indicator to your project data (https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/) Then make a set of objectives that will lead your project from its existing to its ideal maturity level to move along the spectrum of data maturity and FAIR. This will also provide a good exercise in awareness of what the next levels are. This will also provide a good exercise in awareness of what the next levels are.
* 
* Use tooling from goal modelling to define better objectives

---

## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Identify where you are in the maturity model
* Identify your goals / what do you want to achieve…
* Make a plan (e.g. DMP FAIR part and / or FIP) - possible link to Topic 1.4, although this is about policies and not DMPs?
    * Identify bottlenecks for your plan / reflection points: where does my project crew need training? More resources? More personnel?
* …

---

## Materials / Equipment

* **Data Stewardship wizard? https://ds-wizard.org/**
* **Would the list of existing DMP tools and assessment tools help, like this at FAIRassist? https://fairassist.org **
* Need a tool such as DIP4F for FAIRification Objective (e.g. cancer data produced in the project is Findable for the patients community; cancer data produced in the project is reusable by the research community; connect rd data so that we have enough data to run disease natural history studies; accelerate new treatments discovery; Leo’s email) …
* …
