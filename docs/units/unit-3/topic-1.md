## Topic, definition and scope



* Difference between sensitive and personal data 
* Federated data access (local sources)
* Relevant legislations, policies, and recommendations


---

## FAIR element(s) (F, A, I and/or R)



* A - Accessible: working with the community of researchers who have sensitive data and wish to know how to enable FAIR for data that needs to have controlled access.


---

## Primary audience(s)



* Researchers and Project leaders
* Data stewards
* Data controllers and processors
* Data protection officers
* Anyone who creates DMPs
* Students and researchers (including PIs) in life sciences working on personal and sensitive data 


---

## Learning outcomes



* Become familiar with data sharing principles (also: understand what Accessible means in FAIR principles)
* Able to define what is e.g. a controlled access, registered access, etc
* Understand basics of how licensing and archival works in a context of controlled/registered access  
* Know about various (FAIR) data sharing services
* Understand underlying concepts for sensitive data sharing e.g. anonymisation, pseudonymisation
* Learn about various roles relevant to (and involved in) processes for which approvals are required e.g. data controller, data protection officer,
* Relevant agreements e.g. data access agreement, DPIA
* Understand different types of life sciences data in terms of accessibility levels


---

## Summary of Tasks / Actions



* Use case: https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.dab53d [https://fairsharing.org/4203](https://fairsharing.org/4203) or any of the other data [dashboards](https://fairsharing.org/search?userDefinedTags=Dashboard) with FAIRsharing, which deals with sensitive data.
* FAIRsharing’s educational factsheet on databases
* Exercise:Define types of access modes (tip: use examples from own research field)
* Exercise: Reviewing case study (FAIRness of it) and how it can be improved
* Exercise: Prepare (contribute with) a use case from your institution - collect via GitHub?

## Materials / Equipment



* Reading material?
    * Registered access: authorizing data access [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-018-0219-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-018-0219-y)
