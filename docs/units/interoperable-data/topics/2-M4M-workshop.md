## Topic, definition and scope



* Topic: Offering guidance on organising a Metadata for Machines (M4M) workshop in your local organisation
* Origin: GO FAIR Foundation, part of their “[Three-point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/)” to offer guidance to make data FAIR
* Definition (GO FAIR; see below resources): 
    * M4M workshops are agile, hackathon-style events; they are lightweight, fast-track (often 1-day) events to build new, or make informed choices regarding the reuse of already existing metadata schema; they are usually intended to kick-start FAIRification efforts with minimally viable metadata components that are modular, and can be later extended as needed.

## Primary audience(s)



* This lesson plan is designed to train local trainers to facilitate M4M workshops in their local institutions (so a Train-the-Trainer)
* The audience of the M4M workshop itself are twofold (you need both of them to be in the training):
    * Domain experts (who represent a domain community)
    * FAIR metadata experts (data stewards) who guide a discussion leading to the metadata requirements that meet the FAIR data needs of that domain community

## Learning outcomes

    * M4M Workshops have two objectives: 
        * First, most M4M Workshops focus on a simple but extensible conceptual model and RDF schema that solve clearly identified FAIR-related metadata goals for that domain. Based on numerous considerations, the metadata expert will recommend if a new schema should be created or if an existing schema can be efficiently repurposed. In most cases, it is also possible to employ metadata modeling tools to build reusable metadata templates following that schema providing user-friendly interfaces and input forms. This will later allow domain experts who may not have technical skills, to nonetheless create metadata instances without expert supervision. The second objective of a M4M Workshop is the deposition of the defined metadata schema/template into a FAIR repository, where they can be easily found and reused by other communities that often have similar metadata requirements. The overall goal of a M4M Workshop is a public Declaration by the domain community to the use and reuse of particular FAIR metadata schema/templates. This declaration could take the form of a FAIR Implementation Profile or a statement in a Data Management Plan. M4M Workshops draw on the deep knowledge collected in many scientific communities but also ensure coordination with the metadata components chosen in other M4M workshops. Collectively, the M4M workshop series result in recommendations about metadata and an Open repository of machine-ready, easy to use and interoperable FAIR metadata templates and components. Anyone can access this ’sea’ of community specific metadata templates/components, re-use them as they see fit, and deploy them using metadata editors and other data capture tools. It is hoped that the M4M workshop can allow researchers to make routine use of machine-actionable FAIR metadata in a broad range of fields.

## Summary of Tasks / Actions



* **By exporting FAIRsharing metadata using its API, you gain machine-accessible metadata on standards, databases and data policies in JSON format**…We are developing an infographic about this kind of usage, and are happy to share it here once complete
